# MedXpert Backend (FastAPI)

## üìå Overview
MedXpert Backend is the core API server for the MedXpert application, built using **FastAPI**. It enables users to upload medical reports in **PDF or image format**, processes them using **OCR and AI models**, and provides a detailed summary along with **abnormality detection**. Additionally, it features a **chatbot** that can answer user queries based on the medical report data. This backend is designed to be **fast, scalable, and secure**, leveraging modern cloud technologies like **Google Cloud Run** for seamless deployment.

This project aims to make medical reports more understandable by extracting key health indicators and explaining them in simpler terms using **AI-powered natural language processing**.

## üè• Problem Statement & Why MedXpert is Useful
### **The Challenge:**
Understanding medical reports can be challenging for non-medical professionals. Many patients struggle to interpret complex test results, abnormal values, and medical terminology. Additionally, doctors often have limited time to explain reports in detail, leaving patients uncertain about their health conditions.

### **How MedXpert Solves This Problem:**
‚úÖ **Extracts Medical Data:** Automatically extracts text from PDF and image-based reports using **OCR (Tesseract, pdfplumber)**.  
‚úÖ **Summarizes Reports:** Converts complex medical language into **simplified, understandable summaries** using **AI (OpenAI GPT-3.5)**.  
‚úÖ **Detects Abnormalities:** Identifies abnormal values and highlights potential health concerns using **AI-driven analysis**.  
‚úÖ **Provides AI-Powered Chatbot:** Allows users to ask questions about their medical reports and get **instant explanations** using **LLM-based responses**.  
‚úÖ **Improves Accessibility:** Enables easy understanding of health reports, empowering patients to make **informed medical decisions**.  

With MedXpert, users can confidently **analyze their reports, detect potential health risks, and seek appropriate medical consultations faster.**

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository from GitHub. This will download all necessary files to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaspreetSingh-exe/MedXpert-Backend-FastAPI.git
cd MedXpert-Backend-FastAPI
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment ensures that dependencies do not conflict with system-wide Python packages.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This includes libraries like **FastAPI**, **pdfplumber**, **Tesseract OCR**, and **OpenAI API**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file to store your sensitive credentials and API keys.
```bash
touch .env
```
Then, open the `.env` file and add your API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
PORT=8080
```

Load the environment variables securely in your Python code:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Server
Finally, start the FastAPI backend using Uvicorn.
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
```
The `--reload` flag ensures that the server automatically updates when code changes.

## üöÄ Future Work & Enhancements
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Medical Image Classification (MRI, X-rays, CT Scans)**
- **Integration of Deep Learning Models:** Future iterations will incorporate **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for classifying medical images like **X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans**.
- **Use of Pre-trained Models:** Models such as **ResNet, VGG16, EfficientNet**, and **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** will be explored to enhance accuracy.
- **Implementation of DICOM Support:** We aim to support **DICOM format** for medical imaging to ensure compatibility with hospital systems.
- **Example using TensorFlow/Keras:**
  ```python
  from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
  from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
  import numpy as np

  model = ResNet50(weights="imagenet")
  img = image.load_img("xray_image.jpg", target_size=(224, 224))
  img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
  img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
  predictions = model.predict(img_array)
  print(predictions)
  ```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-time Health Risk Prediction**
- **Predictive Analytics using AI:** Integration of AI models that can **predict potential health risks** based on medical history and test results.
- **Integration with Wearables:** Future versions may connect with **smartwatches and health monitoring devices** to provide real-time risk assessments.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Expansion to Multi-Language Support**
- **Using NLP for Medical Translation:** The chatbot will be enhanced with **multi-language support**, making medical information accessible to a wider audience.
- **Translation APIs like Google Translate or OpenAI Whisper** will be used for automatic language detection and translation.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud AI Processing for Scalability**
- **Using Google Cloud AI and AWS SageMaker:** Future enhancements will leverage **cloud-based AI models** to scale medical report analysis for larger datasets.
- **Serverless Processing:** Auto-scaling infrastructure using **Google Cloud Run and AWS Lambda**.

These improvements will help MedXpert evolve into a **comprehensive AI-powered medical assistant** for both patients and healthcare providers. üöÄ

## üìÇ Frontend Integration

The MedXpert Android app acts as the user interface for interacting with the MedXpert Backend API. It handles user inputs, file uploads, and presents the backend-processed data in a clean, user-friendly way.


### üöÄ How the Frontend Uses the Backend:

- **Medical Report Upload**:  
  Users select and upload PDF or image-based medical reports directly through the app. The frontend sends these files to the backend API for processing and awaits the extracted data and analysis.

- **Displaying Summarized Reports**:  
  After processing, the backend returns a simplified summary of the medical report. The frontend displays this summary in an easy-to-read format for users to understand their health status.

- **Abnormality Highlights**:  
  The backend detects abnormal medical values and flags them. The frontend receives this data and visually highlights these abnormalities within the report summary screen to grab the user‚Äôs attention.

- **User Role Enforcement**:  
  The backend tracks user activity (uploads and chatbot usage). Based on the backend's response, the frontend manages feature restrictions (like limiting uploads for guest users).

- **Chatbot Integration**:  
  The frontend provides a chatbot interface where users can ask health-related questions. These questions are sent to the backend, and the frontend displays the AI-generated responses to the user in real time.
